                <p>Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out <br>
                    Get some air now, let your edge out<br>
                    Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind<br>
                    Can you get the heck out?<br>
                    I need rest now, got me bummed out<br>
                    You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe<br>
                    I've been on my empty mind shit<br>
                    <br>
                    I try to keep from losin' the rest of me<br>
                    I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby<br>
                    You don't care<br>
                    Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent<br>
                    Tryna make sense of loose change<br>
                    Got me a war in my mind<br>
                    Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's <br>holding me<br>
                    Choose to watch<br>
                    While the world break up and fall on me<br>
                    All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile<br>
                    Still wanna try, still believe in (good days)<br>
                    Good days, always (good days)<br>
                    Always inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)<br>
                    Good day living in my mind<br>
                    <br>
                    Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations<br>
                    I disappear, if you let me<br>
                    Feeling like (on your own)<br>
                    Feeling like Jericho<br>
                    Feeling like Job when he lost his shit<br>
                    Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I<br>
                    Ooh, paid a deal, way to kill the mood<br>
                    Know you like that shit, yeah, groovy baby, baby<br>
                    Heavy on my empty mind shit<br>
                    I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (losin' the rest of me)<br>
                    Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe<br>
                    You don't care<br>
                    Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent (it's urgent)<br>
                    Tryna make sense of loose change<br>
                    Got me a war in my mind (my mind)<br>
                    Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me<br>
                    Choose to watch<br>
                    While the world break up and fall on me<br>
                    <br>
                    All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile<br>
                    Still wanna try, still believe in (good days, good days on my mind)<br>
                    Good days (good days on my mind)<br>
                    Always sunny inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)<br>
                    Good day living in my mind<br>
                    <br>
                    Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world<br>
                    I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text<br>
                    I just choose not to respond<br>
                    I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened<br>
                    Half of us layin' waste to our youth, is in the present<br>
                    Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now<br>
                    Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind<br>
                    You've been making me feel like I'm<br>
                    Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind<br></p>
